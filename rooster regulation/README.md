# Rooster Regulation - Writing a test suite with Mocha
> A small project that uses Mocha to test the functionality of two methods of an example "Rooster" object.


## General Info
* Build a test suite that is fast, complete, isolated, maintainable, and expressive
* Implement the four phases of test: setup, exercise and verify


## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js v12.19.0
* Mocha v8.2.1


## Features
* Test the methods on the object: .announceDawn and .timeAtDawn
* Use separate "describe" blocks to test the methods
* Use separate "it" blocks for twsting bounds to make test suit maintainable
* Use assert methods for verification

> The result of running the test
