# Factorial Feature - Using test driven development to build a factorial method
> A small project that uses Mocha and the principals of TDD to build a method to calculate factorial on a "Calculate" object.


## General Info
* Use the red, green, refactor cycle to build the method
* Build a test suite that is fast, complete, isolated, maintainable, and expressive
* Implement the four phases of test: setup, exercise and verify


## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js v12.19.0
* Mocha v8.2.1


## Features
* Test the method on the object with two separate "it" blocks
* Test for edge case of 0 x 0 = 1
* Use assert methods for verification


## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices Node.js and testing with Mocha from the Web Developement Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
